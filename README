# project_euler_solutions

Collection of solutions to http://projecteuler.net problems.

## Background

Recently, two of my developers were "arguing" about different programming
languages that they are exploring.  Coming of out of that was a challenge
to implement a simple Project Euler problem using each's language of choice.
This challenge turned into a broader challenge to my development team to
implement solutions in many different programming languages.  This project
is a container for my solutions.
